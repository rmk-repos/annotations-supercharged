For Quickmenu, this is the option
```
{
     "path": "Custom/Annottation Supercharged",
     "menu": "VIEW_MT_annotation_supercharged_main_menu"
},
```


## Features:
1. Hide Layers
2. Show Layers

5. Import color from Color Palette to the layers



This is my first addon and my first exploration in Python. So please expect the unexpected. :)
