It adds itself to the headers of the relevant spaces where annotations are available (3D view, Node editors, Imaged editor, Sequence editor). Also there is a main menu which can be used either with Blender inbuild Quick Favourites or with other addons like https://github.com/passivestar/quickmenu

### For Blender inbuilt quick favourites
1. Use menu search and search for text "super main".

2. If the addon is installed, you will see the following

annotations_supercharged.show_main_menu â–¶Show Main Menu

3. Right click and "Add to Quick Favourites"

### For Quickmenu, this is the configuration to add. 
```
{
     "path": "Custom/Annottation Supercharged",
     "menu": "VIEW_MT_annotation_supercharged_main_menu"
},
```
Note: You may need the latest version of Quickmenu which supports adding menus to the config.json. Here is the Github patch details https://github.com/passivestar/quickmenu/commit/87634d793d40f39af4939bfb927d8e4c00e347fd



**This is my first addon and my first exploration in Python. So please expect the unexpected. :)**
