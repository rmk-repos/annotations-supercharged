# Annotations Supercharged

Handy tools for supercharging your annotations

Current version: 1.0.1
Blender version: 3.3.0

There is no menus or panels or hotkeys by default. But there is a main menu which can be used with other addons like https://github.com/passivestar/quickmenu
For Quickmenu, this is the option
```
{
     "path": "Custom/Annottation Supercharged",
     "menu": "VIEW_MT_annotation_supercharged_main_menu"
},
```

This is my first addon and my first exploration in Python. So please expect the unexpected. :)
